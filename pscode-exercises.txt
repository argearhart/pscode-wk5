// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Input numa and numb
Sum = numa + numb
Return total





// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Take in num
IF num divisible by 2 is True return "Even"
Else if Num divisible by 2 is False return "Odd"




// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Take in num1, num2, num3, num4, num5
Find "Num Average" = sum divided by five 
Return total


For each input 
IF num is less than all the other nums then return "num=minimum" 
ELSE IF num is greater all the other nums then return "num=maxiumum"
